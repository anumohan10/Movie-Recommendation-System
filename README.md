### Project Overview 📌

The **Movie Recommendation System** aims to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and viewing history. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes movie data to predict and recommend films tailored to individual tastes.

### Dataset 📊

- **Source:** [Kaggle TMDb Movie Metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
- **Features:**
  - Extensive information on movie revenues, crew details, audience ratings, and more.
  - Data includes genres, cast, and keywords for each movie.

### Project Goals 🎯

- Enhance the user experience by simplifying content discovery.
- Utilize machine learning to predict and recommend movies based on user preferences.

### Methodology 🔍

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
  - Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
  - Extracted genres, cast, and keywords, converting them into strings.
  - Applied stemming to standardize text data.

- **Modeling and Recommendations:**
  - Utilized cosine similarity to measure the closeness between different movie vectors, essential for recommending similar movies.
  - Developed a recommendation function to suggest movies based on user input.
